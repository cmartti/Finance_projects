    "## Basket Option on Two Underlying Stocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will have two dimensions to integrate over, the Quasi Monte Carlo will be a better alternative than the ordinary Monte Carlo methods. This method can handle these types of problems with greater accuracy and faster convergence than regular Monte Carlo, since the options payoff depens on smooth functions of the underlying assets. The QMC will be implemented with a Sobol sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low discrepancy sequences such as Sobol sequenses are designed to fill out the space of possible values more evenly than purely random samples. These types of sequences reduce the likelihood of missing important areas of the payoff distribution. This leads to more accurate estimates for the basket option pricing. The stocks will also be correlated and modelling this with a Sobol sequence can capture this relationship more accuratley than random smapling.\n",
